# 🎬 Movie Recommender System  
**Developed by Abhijeet Solanki**

## 🔍 Overview  
The Movie Recommender System is a web app that suggests **5 similar movies** based on a user’s selected favorite film. It's designed to skip the endless scrolling and decision fatigue by using content-based filtering with intuitive visuals.

## 🗂️ Dataset
For this recommender system, I have used the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. Before proceeding, first download the dataset from the URL below:

## 🧠 System Architecture  

![System Architecture](Asset/System-Architecture.png)

### 📌 Components:
#### 1. **Frontend (Streamlit)**  
- Dropdown to select a movie  
- Button to trigger recommendations  
- Renders titles and posters interactively  

#### 2. **Backend (Recommendation Engine)**  
- Loads metadata from `model.pkl`  
- Computes similarity scores using content-based filtering  
- Retrieves the top 5 movie recommendations  

#### 3. **External API (TMDB)**  
- Fetches high-quality posters using TMDB’s REST API  
- Displays a default image if a poster is missing

## 🔁 User Interaction Flow  

![User Interaction Flow](Asset/MR-User-Interation-Flow.png)

1. The user selects a movie via a dropdown.  
2. Frontend sends the movie title to the backend.  
3. Backend loads metadata and the similarity model.  
4. Computes the top 5 similar movies.  
5. Fetches poster URLs via TMDB API.  
6. Frontend renders recommendations dynamically.

```bash
├── app.py                      # Streamlit frontend
├── MovieRecommenderSystem.ipynb # Backend logic & model creation
├── model.pkl                   # Precomputed similarity matrix

## 🚀 How to Run Locally
Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChiefAj23/Movie-Recommender-System.git
cd Movie-Recommender-System
```
Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Add your TMDB API key (create one in your [TMDB API settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api))
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then open .env and replace the placeholder with your key
```
The app reads the key from the `TMDB_API_KEY` environment variable, so instead of using `.env` you can `export TMDB_API_KEY=<your key>` in your shell, or set it in your host's secrets settings when deploying. `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`, so your key stays out of the repo.

Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📢 Future Features
- Add user-based collaborative filtering.
- Allow genre-based filtering.
- Display movie plots and ratings.
- Add user login, and the user can rate movies.
- Enable trailer previews.
